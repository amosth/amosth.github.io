                        <p class="solution">This essay is aimed to present, explain and reflect on a mockup of a visualization
                            focused on the topic of <em>Journalistic Data Storytelling</em>: through this topic, it has been expected
                            to realize an engaging information visualization tool to support Donald Trump’s ideas on <em>climate
                            change</em>, together with the exploitation of <em>dark patterns</em>. Most significant images of the mockup
                            will be presented to support concepts and ideas through the essay.
                        </p>
                        <p class="solution">
                            Since the visualization in analysis is meant to support Donald Trump’s agenda, it has been straightforwardly
                            assumed that it could be made available on his website with a target set on American citizens.
                            <a class="inline-link" href="#fig1">Figure 1</a> proposes real Trump’s landing page with a climate report in
                            evidence, containing the visualization. Three main sections are provided within the visualization: the first
                            one (<strong>S1</strong>), <em>Global Warming</em>, offers absolute low temperatures data on American soil
                            (<a class="inline-link" href="#wiki2021a">Wikipedia, 2021a</a>), together with mean temperature anomalies data
                            (<a class="inline-link" href="#gcag2016">GCAG, 2016</a>); the second section (<strong>S2</strong>), <em>CO2
                            Emissions v Sea Level Rising</em>, presents data on carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels by USA and China
                            (<a class="inline-link" href="#cdiac2014">CDIAC, 2014</a>), compared with the global average absolute sea level
                            change (<a class="inline-link" href="#csiro2015">CSIRO, 2015</a>); finally, the third section (<strong>S3</strong>),
                            <em>Trends in Atmospheric CO2</em>, shows the annual mean of carbon dioxide mole fraction
                            (<a class="inline-link" href="#esrl2017">ESRL, 2017</a>). Once the user decides to consult the Climate report page,
                            they will be brought to the first visualization’s section <strong>S1</strong>. Each of these sections start with an introductory part
                            and, apart from the last section <strong>S3</strong>, scrolling will be needed in order to reach the actual visualizations (see
                            <a class="inline-link" href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>). We will now focus on their visualization’s representation,
                            presentation and interaction aspects, along with the dark patterns used.

                        <p class="solution">
                            According to Spence’s Reference Model (<a class="inline-link" href="#spence2014">2014, p.37</a>), representation
                            is aimed to present data clearly to the mind (<a class="inline-link" href="#spence2014">Spence, 2014, p.42</a>).
                            In our case, all core data provided by <a class="inline-link ext-link" href="https://datahub.io/collections/climate-change"><code class="code-text">datahub.io</code></a>
                            came in form of tables: as we know, tables are of limited help and their data needs to be rearranged into some other representation
                            (<a class="inline-link" href="#spence2014">Spence, 2014, p.23</a>). One important aspect to take into account is data
                            derived from the domain of climate change. In this context, all data share a pivotal dimension as attribute: time.
                            On a representation level, therefore, came the decision of representing data through two-dimensional graphs on
                            all the visualization’s sections, as common way to represent time-varying data. Graphs aren’t an opinion: they
                            represent cold hard numbers. Yet, all proposed graphs in the visualization are misleading, since they take advantage
                            of dark patterns. Scales have been vastly distorted by important lie factors (<a class="inline-link" href="#craven2001">Craven, 2001</a>)
                            to shape skeptical opinions against the topic of climate change. That refers, to some extent, to the misdirection dark
                            pattern category (<a class="inline-link" href="#mathur2019">Mathur et al, 2019, p.16</a>): design purposefully focuses
                            user’s attention on the coloured graph’s curves rather than on their scales. <strong>S1</strong> deserves a particular mention:
                            text, a timeline and a map are used as other means of representation in addition to the graph (see <a class="inline-link" href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>).
                        </p>

                            since users are guided through a series of steps, wishing to change their thinking. <strong>S3</strong> also provides the timeline
                            artifact below the graph representation (see <a class="inline-link" href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>).<br>

                        <p class="solution">
                            Turning attention on the presentation and interaction aspects, <strong>S1</strong> (<a class="inline-link" href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>)
                            presents a vertical thermometer-shaped timeline, indicating the six visualization’s steps. To know at which step the user is currently
                            in, different indicators are available: the inner red level, together with a white dot on its top; or the extended blue notch towards
                            the text indicating <em>date</em>, <em>location</em> and <em>temperature</em> recorded. Just as Spence suggests (<a class="inline-link" href="#spence2014">2014, p.184</a>),
                            when an attribute limit is changed, the effect is shown immediately. As soon as the user <em>brushes</em> through any of the steps on the
                            thermometer (<em>SI</em>, or <em>sensitivity-interaction</em>), related state’s area in the map becomes solid red and data showed in text updates (<em>SM</em>,
                            or <em>sensitivity-movement</em>), while the others with data available remain presented with red stripes as an <em>affordance</em>
                            (<a class="inline-link" href="#spence2014">Spence, 2014, p.178</a>), suggesting interaction. By hovering over these states, a <em>ToolTip</em> showing
                            some data will appear. The map on the right is tightly connected to the thermometer. We may identify a technique Spence calls <em>Invisible Links</em>
                            (<a class="inline-link" href="#spence2014">Spence, 2014, p.85</a>): the thermometer’s level, in fact, implies a link with the highlighted
                            state on the map. A <em>down</em> arrow at the bottom suggests the user to <em>scroll</em> down towards the final page, which will present global
                            temperature <em>anomalies</em> on a vertically compressed graph (see <a class="inline-link" href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>). Here, additional text
                            is used to persuade the user. As will happen for all other graphs in other sections of the whole visualization, interaction is allowed
                            by hovering over the curve to get more detailed data.
                        </p>

                        <p class="solution">
                            A slightly different approach has been used for the graph on <strong>S2</strong> (see <a class="inline-link" href="#fig6">Figure 6</a>): since
                            correlation between carbon emissions and sea level change was needed, a second <em>y-axis</em> has been embedded. Here, the <em>y-axes</em> hide
                            <em>distortion</em> by offering inconsistent data points, even if the underlying grid makes it look like they’re consistent. Curves of
                            <em>carbon emissions</em> from USA and China are presented as bubbles simulating the smoke coming out of factories. To present China’s data,
                            in particular, a technique called <em>Cherry Picking</em> (<a class="inline-link" href="#teded2017">TEDEd, 2017</a>) has been applied: only
                            data since 1920 - the most significant time range - is being presented, in order to show the massive increase in carbon emissions.
                            That would also solve the spatial problem of placing the factory representing China at a different starting point of the USA’s one.
                        </p>

                            The user may also want to <em>filter out</em> data and highlight China’s carbon emission’s curve, for instance, by clicking on the respective
                            factory (see <a class="inline-link" href="#fig7">Figure 7</a>); as you may notice, the y-axis labels not dealing with the selected data are
                            <em>greyed out</em>. Another component to observe is the <em>banner</em> above the graph, including a deceptive <strong>Countdown Counter</strong>

                            will appear (see <a class="inline-link" href="#fig8">Figure 8</a>) and the user will be forced to interact, since the rest of the screen will get freezed out:
                            this somehow follows the dark pattern called <strong>Roach Motel</strong>, where it’s very easy to get into a certain situation,
                            but then makes it hard to get out of it (<a class="inline-link" href="#brignull2018">Brignull, 2018</a>). The only way to get out of this situation will be by
                            clicking on <em>“No, I’m fine with letting ourselves drown”</em>: a clear example of <strong>Confirmshaming</strong>, using language
                            and emotion (shame) to steer users away from making a certain choice (<a class="inline-link" href="#mathur2019">Mathur et al, 2019, p. 12</a>).

                            The graph is distorted in the way that part of the y-axis is cut out: this technique is quite known and, as suggested by Huff
                            (<a class="inline-link" href="#huff1954">1954, p.62</a>), <em>“if any carping fellow objects to your misleading graph, you may say you’ve saved paper too”</em>.
                            This technique, in our case, made us save some screen real estate. It’s crucial to mention that the y-axis is displaying data on a <em>logarithmic scale</em>.
                            A peculiarity about this visualization is the interactive timeline under the graph, similar to what Spence calls <em>Dynamic Queries</em>
                            (<a class="inline-link" href="#spence2014">2014, p.67</a>), supporting exploration of data between different time frames,
                            filtering out possible distracting ranges to reduce <em>cognitive effort</em> involved in a search. The play button suggests <em>animation</em>,
                            making the curve populate with data year by year. Finally, if the user notices the logarithmic scale, a <em>tab bar</em> may apparently allow them to
                            change the y-axis into a linear scale. As Fogg suggests (<a class="inline-link" href="#fogg2009">2009</a>), the easier a task appears, the more responsive
                            people are likely to be, so the tab bar artifact is a perfect tool as easy and immediate to make the user interact with it.

                            <a class="inline-link" href="#fig10">Figure 10</a>). This may be considered as some sort of instance of the <strong>Disguised Ads</strong> dark pattern,

                            By facing the task of creating an information visualization tool on climate change for Donald Trump’s come-back in 2024,
                            many limiting challenges arouse: first of all, the constraint of basing the visualization mainly on datasets coming from the
                            collection on climate change on <a class="inline-link ext-link" href="https://datahub.io/collections/climate-change"><code class="code-text">datahub.io</code></a>.
                            Data from this source just shout out on an impressive climate change, removing all doubt on any thought against it, that is
                            rapidly affecting our globe: data also reports some parameters (i.e. carbon dioxide emissions or population growth) proving
                            how humans are a contributing cause to climate change, making it even more difficult to being included in a visualization
                            tool supporting the client’s ideas, where - in out case - the client is the <em>45th President of the United States of America</em>.
                            In a book called <em>The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump</em>, 27 psychiatrists point out the former president’s psychological
                            dangerousness from observed behaviour, where the unthinkable becomes the norm (<a class="inline-link" href="#lee2017">Lee, 2017</a>),
                            like deliriously thinking that climate change does not exist. To be mentioned the striking event of his second impeachment in
                            January 2021, questioning his presidency capacity of powers and duties under the <em>25th Amendment</em>
                            (<a class="inline-link" href="#wiki2021b">Wikipedia, 2021b</a>).

                            The goal was, therefore, to subvert reality and present data in a <em>machiavellian</em>, diabolic yet persuasive way. At this point,
                            the use of dark patterns on a deceptive dimension - that is inducing false beliefs (<a class="inline-link" href="#mathur2019">Mathur et al, 2019, p.5</a>)
                            - for this visualization became not only an option but a necessity, as described in the explanation part for Misdirection, Roach Motel, Confirmshaming
                            and Disguised Ads. Most of the research - which then influenced the solution design - was done on <em>misleading graphs</em>, as meant as graphs that distract
                            the user from fully understanding what they’re viewing: one source used is a TEDEd video <em>"How to spot a misleading graph"</em> produced by the
                            former Harvard University student Lea Gaslowitz (<a class="inline-link" href="#teded2017">TEDEd, 2017</a>), combined with a deepening page on misleading
                            graphs on her website <a class="inline-link ext-link" href="https://www.frontporchmath.com"><code class="code-text">www.frontporchmath.com</code></a>
                            (<a class="inline-link" href="#gaslowitz2017">Gaslowitz, 2017</a>). This of course counters Tufte’s concept of <em>graphical integrity</em>, whose excellence
                            begins with telling the truth about data (<a class="inline-link" href="#tufte2001">2001</a>).

                            On <strong>S1</strong>, the United States map facilitates the user forming a useful mental model and making rapid judgments, by letting them associate
                            the different record low temperatures to the different states: in other words, this representation allows to achieve what Spence calls a <em>qualitative awareness</em>
                            of some aspect of data (<a class="inline-link" href="#spence2014">2014, p.25</a>). The glass thermometer, instead, is purposefully presented in a
                            misleading way, since it is actually used to present a timeline: as the user scrolls down, its level will shrink and the visualization will go through
                            the record low temperatures from <em>less</em> to <em>most</em> recent (not from <em>highest</em> to <em>lowest</em>). This concept is supposed to
                            counter the idea of global warming, as to make the user suspecting how that could be real since very low temperatures are still recorded. Moreover, in
                            some cases the proposed record low temperatures may not be that astonishing: hence, to make them feel like very low, the choice of displaying them
                            in <em>Celsius</em> rather than in <em>Fahrenheit</em>, usually resulting in a lower number. American citizens are also not so practiced with that
                            unit of measure, so that’s another useful way to bias them.

                                    inconsistent data points, making China’s emissions look more and USA’s ones look less than they are;

                                    would result in a quite more worrying curve in trends of carbon dioxide in atmosphere.

                            Graphs were also chosen for another reason: they were identified as most flexible, simple and quick artifacts to produce and straightforwardly
                            combine with dark patterns and techniques to trick users. Graphs, though, may result a bit boring: in case it would have been given more time
                            to realize the information visualization in analysis, some more time-consuming yet more fun and <em>interesting-to-observe</em> alternatives
                            to misleading graphs would have been considered. The challenge would not be only to choose from the many other alternatives to represent
                            <em>time-varying data</em> - a couple of eligible examples may be the <em>ThemeRiver</em> (<a class="inline-link" href="#spence2014">Spence, 2014, p.54</a>)
                            and the <em>Nightingale’s diagram</em> (<a class="inline-link" href="#spence2014">Spence, 2014, p.60</a>), both rather effective in showing changes
                            over time - but also then find good ways to combine those representations with the dark patterns, needed to bias users.

                            data source from the <a class="inline-link ext-link" href="https://datahub.io/collections/climate-change"><code class="code-text">datahub.io</code></a>
                            climate change collection (<a class="inline-link" href="#climate4you2021">Climate4You, 2021</a>). It reconstructs global temperature over the

                            observe, given such a great timespan, some <em>cyclicality</em> occurs: this would even support Trump’s thesis of climate change not being affected by humans;
                            on the other hand, though, any dark pattern - even if required - wouldn’t be needed. Also, a possible representation technique that would perfectly fit to
                            indicate such repetitions would be the <em>Arc Diagrams</em> (<a class="inline-link" href="#spence2014">Spence, 2014, p.55</a>).
